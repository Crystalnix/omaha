Omaha is the open-source version of Google Update, a program to install requested software and keep it up to date. The Google-branded version of Omaha is used to support software patching (both background updating, and on-demand update checks) for Google Chrome, Earth, and a variety of other Google products on Windows.

* Remember the Omaha client is only for Windows.

This directory contains IDL files from the Mozilla source tree (circa Mozilla
1.7).  These IDL files are copied here because they do not exist in the Gecko
SDK.  Eventually, the hope is that the Gecko SDK will expand to include these
interfaces.  For now, we keep these in a separate directory, with the idea that
this directory will some day go away.

Some files have been modified slightly, usually to change the name of an
interface to deal with cases where multiple versions of the same interface are
needed.  Modified files should include a comment explaining what has changed.

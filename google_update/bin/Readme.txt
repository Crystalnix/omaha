This directory contains the saved "constant" version of the GoogleUpdate.exe
shell. Using the same executable avoids firewall prompts in some cases when
updating Google Update.

This shell can only be used with goopdate.dll files that have been signed with
the real certificate.

When updating the shell, also change the expected version in
..\google_update_unittest.cc.
